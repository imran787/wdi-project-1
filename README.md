How to play

Upon clicking of the Start button the Player is presented with a 10x10 grid with a start point and must use the directional keys to navigate a path to the end point(marked with a door). In doing so the Player must also avoid the obstacles that have been randomly placed on the grid. The player is aided here with a momentary flash of the obstacle positions and must recall their locations to aid in his navigation of the grid.
