Introduction

The Game is a single player maze game with elements of a memory game based on classic Pokemon mini games that uses memory recall as an ....This has was built as my first project on the Web Development Immersive programme at General Assembly. The aim of this project was to consolidate the learnt materials of the first few weeks of the programme that focused on Javascript, CSS and HTML.

How to play

Upon clicking of the Start button the Player is presented with a 10x10 grid with a start point and must use the directional keys to navigate a path to the end point(marked with a door). In doing so the Player must also avoid the obstacles that have been randomly placed on the grid. The player is aided here with a momentary flash of the obstacle positions and must recall their locations to aid in his navigation of the grid. Furthermore,  a very limited number of sweets are placed at random on the grid that may give the player a further flash of the obstacle positions when consumed.
